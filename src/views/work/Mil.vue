            The design of this home was driven by the owners' desire for a
            three-bedroom waterfront home that showcased the spectacular views
            and park-like setting. As nature lovers, they wanted their home to
            be organic, minimize any environmental impact on the sensitive site
            and embrace nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            This unique home is sited on a high ridge with a 45Â° slope to the
            water on the right and a deep ravine on the left. The five-acre site
            is completely wooded and tree preservation was a major emphasis.
            Very few trees were removed and special care was taken to protect
            the trees and environment throughout the project. To further
            minimize disturbance, grades were not changed and the home was
            designed to take full advantage of the site's natural topography.
            Oak from the home site was re-purposed for the mantle, powder room
            counter and select furniture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The visually powerful twin pavilions were born from the need for
            level ground and parking on an otherwise challenging site. Fill dirt
            excavated from the main home provided the foundation. All structures
            are anchored with a natural stone base and exterior materials
            include timber framing, fir ceilings, shingle siding, a partial
            metal roof and corten steel walls. Stone, wood, metal and glass
            transition the exterior to the interior and large wood windows flood
            the home with light and showcase the setting. Interior finishes
            include reclaimed heart pine floors, Douglas fir trim, dry-stacked
            stone, rustic cherry cabinets and soapstone counters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exterior spaces include a timber-framed porch, stone patio with fire
            pit and commanding views of the Occoquan reservoir. A second porch
            overlooks the ravine and a breezeway connects the garage to the
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numerous energy-saving features have been incorporated, including
            LED lighting, on-demand gas water heating and special insulation.
            Smart technology helps manage and control the entire house.
